                        <u>Background</u>
                        <p></p>
                        Water is an essential resource for human survival. It makes up arpund 60% of our bodies and covers 71% of the world. Without water, life would not exist. Even so, water pollution is still an increasing problem recently with around 51% of all water on earth being contaminated. More than 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water.
                        </p>
                        <u>Cause and Effects</u>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                        It occurs when harmful substances, such as chemicals, plastics, and waste, are discharged into water bodies, making them unsafe for human consumption and harmful to aquatic life. Water pollution can be caused by a variety of factors, including industrial and agricultural activities, improper waste disposal, oil spills, and natural phenomena such as floods and droughts. Industrial activities, such as manufacturing and mining, are major contributors to water pollution. These industries often discharge harmful chemicals and waste into nearby water bodies, contaminating them with toxins that can harm both humans and wildlife. Improper waste disposal is another major cause of water pollution. All of this can have major impacts on human health and the environment. Water pollution can cause a wide range of health problems including skin diseases, diarrhea, respiratory diseases and cancer. When water bodies become contaminated with chemicals and toxins, fish and other wildlife may die or become sick, which can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem.

                        <u>Solutions</u>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                        While these issues and concerns for the future are very severe, there are many organizations working to find solutions and help on a global scale. Pacific institute "adresses climate impacts on access to water and sanitation, as well as livelihoods and well-being for frontline communities in the United States and around the world. [Their] work focuses on scaling uptake of nature-based conditions that support more climate-resilient water systems and the communites they support." The World Water Council's "mission is to gather the international community  to convince decision-makers that water is a vital political priority for the sustainable and equitable development of the planet. Founded in 1996, the World Water Council has become an influential leader, working to position water at the top of the global political agenda." The International Water Association beleives that "water is at the heart of sustainable development, critical for economic development, environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. [They] inspire change through connecting water to issues that underpin global development goals." You can help to prevent water pollution by properly disposing of waste, conserving water, and avoiding the use of harmful chemicals and pesticides. Advocating and volunteering to fight against water pollution is one way you can help on your own.
