                First let me tell you a little about him. Sayed is a senior age 17 and he goes to NEST+m. He has one sister named Sayda. He is going to Colgate university for neuroscience because he wants to become a doctor.

                Sayed is so silly and funny and has amazing hair. He thinks he's soooooo smart but he's pretty dumb. His bestfriend is shark boy and they both skip every class together. He is so amazing at computer science and I wish I could be more like him.
            </p>
            <p>
                He loooves drama. He loves knowing about everything that's happening to everyone. and he loves ms. tanzosh. His eyelashes are out of this world. I will miss him so much when he's gone.
